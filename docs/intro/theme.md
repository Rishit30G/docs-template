## Theming and Configuration 🎨⚙️

Welcome to the documentation on theming and configuration. In this section, we'll explore how we've organized and optimized the styling and configuration aspects of our application to enhance user experience and maintain code quality.

### Theming with Styled-Components 💅

To ensure consistent and maintainable styling throughout our application, we've leveraged the power of Styled-Components. This approach allows us to encapsulate styling logic within individual components, leading to better modularity and easier theming changes. By adopting this methodology, we've made our codebase more elegant, readable, and adaptable to changing design requirements.

### Global Theme Configuration 🌐

Our application's theme plays a crucial role in delivering a visually appealing user experience. We've implemented a global theme configuration that centralizes color schemes, typography, and other design attributes. This not only promotes design consistency but also simplifies the process of tweaking the theme to align with our brand identity or accommodating user preferences.

### Dark Mode and Fullscreen Loader 🌙

With user preferences in mind, we've integrated a dark mode feature that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. Additionally, we've designed a sleek fullscreen loader that engages users during loading processes. These enhancements contribute to a smoother and more engaging user experience.

### Linting and Code Formatting with ESLint and Prettier 🧹

Maintaining a clean and standardized codebase is essential for collaboration and maintainability. We've set up ESLint and Prettier to enforce coding conventions, catch potential errors, and ensure consistent code formatting. This automated approach helps us focus on writing quality code without worrying about style inconsistencies. We've also integrated Husky to ensure these checks are run automatically before each commit, preventing subpar code from being committed.

### Automated Pre-Commit Checks with Husky 🐶

To prevent code that doesn't meet our quality standards from being committed, we've integrated Husky into our workflow. Husky runs automated checks before each commit, ensuring that linting, formatting, and other pre-commit tasks are successfully completed. This practice guarantees that only clean and properly formatted code is added to our repository, maintaining a high level of code quality.

### URLs Configuration 🌐

Managing environment-specific URLs is crucial for smooth operation in different deployment environments. We've implemented a URLs configuration that dynamically selects the appropriate set of URLs based on the environment. This ensures that our application always communicates with the correct APIs and services, whether in development or production.

<!-- ### Setting Up Docker 🐳

For seamless deployment and containerization, we've created a Dockerfile that encapsulates our application's runtime environment. This simplifies the deployment process, ensures consistent behavior across different environments, and facilitates scaling if needed. -->

By investing time in theming, configuration, and automated processes, we've not only improved the visual appeal and functionality of our application but also laid a strong foundation for maintainability, scalability, and user satisfaction. Our commitment to quality coding practices, user-centric design, and streamlined configuration underscores our dedication to delivering a top-notch application.
