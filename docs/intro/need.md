## 
Our goal was to make the application more optimized and fast from the existing one. Through rigorous refactoring, we elevated our code to meet the pinnacle of coding standards. Each file now seamlessly balances logic and functionality, with thoughtful abstractions that pave the way for streamlined testing. Furthermore, this transformation underlines our unwavering commitment to user experience. As we've fine-tuned our app's backbone, we've also laid a robust foundation for future enhancements.

### Broad use cases we targeted
<br />

âœ…  **Bringing LOC to close to 250 lines:**
In our endeavor to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase, we've streamlined our main file by abstracting critical functionalities. By segregating the get-bot-list and socket-connection logic into separate files and then integrating them into the main file as components, we successfully reduced the lines of code (LOC) in the main file by approximately 30%. This ensures better readability and promotes modular development.


âœ… **Deploying [socket package](https://main--sage-syrniki-b31f4f.netlify.app/developer-experience#socket-io-) for connection:**
To bolster our refactoring and optimization efforts, the socket-connection logic was transformed into a standalone npm package. By modularizing this critical functionality, we've paved the way for easier updates and potentially sharing this utility with the broader developer community.


âœ… **Setting up [Redux](https://main--sage-syrniki-b31f4f.netlify.app/developer-experience#redux-toolkit-) for global state management:**
Recognizing the need for a streamlined state management solution to boost application performance, we integrated Redux into our tech stack. By transitioning crucial pieces of data like messages and getbotlist to Redux, we've enabled a more cohesive and optimized state management. This strategic move ensures faster loading times and a more consistent user experience

âœ… **Testing the application:**
Testing is paramount to ensuring that our application not only functions as expected but also remains robust in various scenarios. To that end, we employed PlaywrightJS for crafting diverse test cases. Our tests rigorously assess various scenarios such as ensuring socket connection integrity during messaging, evaluating application response under no internet connectivity,
and validating that there are no multiple, unintended socket instances.
