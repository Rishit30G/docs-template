### Using ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for Code Consistency ‚ú®

Maintaining consistent code quality and style is essential for collaborative development. We've integrated ESLint, Prettier, and Husky into our project to help you achieve code consistency effortlessly.

#### Setting Up ESLint and Prettier

1.**Installation**:
   - ESLint, Prettier, and other related packages are already listed in your `package.json` under `devDependencies`.
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.


2.**Configuration Files**:
   - ESLint: Configure ESLint rules in `.eslintrc.js`.
   - Prettier: Customize Prettier formatting options in `.prettierrc.js`.

3. **Running ESLint and Prettier**:
   - Use `npm run lint` to run ESLint and catch linting errors.
   - Use `npm run format` to apply Prettier formatting to `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.md` files.

#### Running Lint and Format Scripts

We've set up two scripts to help you maintain code consistency:

1. **Linting** (`npm run lint`):
   - When you run `npm run lint`, ESLint will analyze your code for potential errors, style violations, and adherence to coding standards.
   - The main ESLint configuration file is located in the root of your project. It establishes global rules and settings.

2. **Formatting** (`npm run format`):
   - Running `npm run format` triggers Prettier to automatically format `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.md` files according to the configuration in `.prettierrc.js`.
   - Prettier enforces a consistent code style, such as indentation, line breaks, and more.

#### ESLint Configuration for Different Directories

Our project follows a modular structure, and each directory might have specific coding standards. To accommodate this, we have individual ESLint configurations for each directory. These configurations can be found within the respective directories.

When you run `npm run lint`, ESLint will consider both the root configuration and any specific configurations in subdirectories. This ensures that your code adheres to the appropriate coding standards throughout the entire project.

For example:
- The root `.eslintrc.js` file contains global rules that apply to the entire project.
- In the `apps/uci` directory, you might find an `.eslintrc.js` file with rules tailored to the specific app.
- Similar `.eslintrc.js` files might be present in other directories, such as `packages/*` and `tsdx/*`.

#### Automating Code Consistency Checks with Husky

1. **Pre-Commit Hooks**:
   - Husky enables you to define actions that run automatically before commits are made.
   - Inside the `.husky` folder, you'll find a pre-commit hook file (e.g., `pre-commit`) that triggers linting and formatting checks before every commit.

2. **Customizing Pre-Commit Hooks**:
   - To add new pre-commit hooks, create additional executable files inside the `.husky` folder.
   - For example, create a file named `pre-commit-newhook` and add your desired actions, like running tests or additional linting tasks.

3. **Enforcing Consistency**:
   - When you attempt to make a commit, Husky will run the pre-commit hooks.
   - If any hook fails (e.g., ESLint finds issues or Prettier formatting is incorrect), the commit will be blocked, prompting you to fix the issues before proceeding.

#### Further Customization and Resources

1. **Adding More Hooks**:
   - Expand your `.husky` folder to include hooks for additional checks, like testing, security scans, or documentation validation.

2. **Learn More**:
   - Dive deeper into ESLint and Prettier configurations by referring to their official documentation:
     - ESLint: [Official Documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)
     - Prettier: [Official Documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)
   - Explore Husky's capabilities in its official documentation: [Official Documentation](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

Now, you can focus on writing code while Husky and our consistent code tools take care of maintaining clean and formatted code automatically.

### Global Theme Management and Dark Mode üé®

Maintaining a consistent and visually appealing user interface is crucial for any application. Our project provides a robust global theme management system that includes support for a dark mode. This allows you to seamlessly manage the appearance of your app and provide a better user experience.

### Theme Configuration

We've organized our theme configuration into a dedicated file, `theme.ts`, where you can customize various design elements to create a visually consistent app.

Here are some key components of the theme configuration:

- **`theme_styles`**: Contains a set of text styles, margins, paddings, and image dimensions. This helps maintain a consistent visual layout across the app.

- **`dark_theme`**: Defines the properties for the dark mode. It specifies background colors, font colors, and other visual elements that contribute to a cohesive dark mode experience.

- **`light_theme`**: Specifies the properties for the light mode, including background colors, font colors, and shadows.

#### Using the Theme Provider

We've implemented a `ThemeProvider` component that encapsulates the logic for theme management, including toggling between light and dark modes.

1. **Installation**:
   - To start using the theme provider, import it into your component file:

     ```javascript
     import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from './ThemeProvider'; // Update the path as needed
     ```

2. **Implementation**:
   - Wrap your application's root component with the `ThemeProvider`:

     ```javascript
     function App() {
         return (
             <ThemeProvider>
                 {/* Your app's components */}
             </ThemeProvider>
         );
     }
     ```

3. **Using the Theme Context**:
   - To access the theme and toggle functionality, use the `useTheme` hook within your components:

     ```javascript
     import { useTheme } from './ThemeProvider'; // Update the path as needed

     function SomeComponent() {
         const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

         return (
             <div style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.color }}>
                 {/* Your component's content */}
                 <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
             </div>
         );
     }
     ```

#### Customizing Theme Colors and Using Local Storage üé®

Our global theme management system provides flexibility for adopters to customize the colors of the theme in both light and dark modes. Additionally, we utilize local storage to store and remember user preferences for the selected theme mode.

#### Customizing Theme Colors

To customize theme colors for both light and dark modes, follow these steps:

1. Open the `theme.ts` file in your project.

2. Locate the `dark_theme` and `light_theme` objects. These objects contain properties that define colors, backgrounds, and other visual elements for their respective modes.

3. Update the color values within the theme objects to your desired hex codes or color names. For example:

   ```javascript
   export const dark_theme = {
       // ...
       background: '#1E1E1E', // Update to your desired color
       color: '#FFFFFF',     // Update to your desired font color
       // ...
   };

   export const light_theme = {
       // ...
       background: '#FFFFFF', // Update to your desired color
       color: '#333333',     // Update to your desired font color
       // ...
   };


#### Importance of Theme Management

Consistent theming not only enhances the visual appeal of your app but also provides a seamless experience for users. Users can choose between light and dark modes based on their preference and lighting conditions.

By centralizing theme management, you simplify the process of maintaining a cohesive design language throughout your app. Whether you're building new components or expanding existing ones, you can confidently use the defined theme styles and elements to create a unified user interface.

Feel free to customize the theme properties in the `theme.ts` file to align with your app's branding and design guidelines.

Now you have the power to create a visually stunning and user-friendly app while ensuring that your design remains consistent across different screens and modes.
