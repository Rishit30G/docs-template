## Installation Steps :walking:

### 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Sunbird-UCI](https://github.com/samagra-comms/uci-web-channel) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.

### 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to a local machine using

```sh
git clone https://github.com/samagra-comms/uci-web-channel.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `Sunbird-UCI` repository in GitHub, move to that folder first using the change directory command.

This will change directory to a folder

```sh
cd uci-web-channel
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

### 3. Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that _your local copy_ has a reference to _your forked remote repository_ in GitHub :octocat:

```sh
git remote -v
```

By running the above command, you can see that the local copy has a reference to the forked remote repository in GitHub.

```
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/uci-web-channel.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/uci-web-channel.git (push)
```

### 4. Run it :checkered_flag:

- Install dependencies

```
yarn install or npm install 
```

Browse it on: ```http://localhost:3003```

### 5. Rendering Offline ðŸ’»

- Build the code

```
yarn build or npm run build 
```

- Run application in dev environment

```
yarn start or npm run dev 
```
