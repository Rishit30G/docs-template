## 

Our goal was able offline support for Family ID, a Next.js application. By implementing caching of essential assets and data, serving API responses from service workers, and synchronizing local storage with the database, so that users can enjoy uninterrupted access even without an internet connection. This transformation will enhance user experiences and ensure smooth interactions, fostering a seamless journey for Family ID's users, regardless of their connectivity status.

### Broad Use Cases we targeted
<br />

✅  **Caching Assets and Styling for Offline Mode:**
The first step for Family ID is to cache all essential assets, including JavaScript files, CSS styling, and images. By utilizing service workers, we can store these resources locally on the user's device. As a result, even when the user is offline, they can access and interact with the app, ensuring uninterrupted service.


✅ **Serving API Responses from Service Workers:**
To enhance offline support further, we have leveraged service workers to intercept network requests and serve cached API responses when the user is offline. 


✅ **Storing User Interaction Data in Local Storage:**
To achieve this, we have implemented local storage capabilities, enabling the app to store user interactions and changes locally. Whether it's filling out forms or marking tasks complete, the app capture these actions, safeguarding user data during offline periods.


✅ **Syncing Local Storage with the Database:**
When the user comes back online after an offline session, we ensure that the locally stored data syncs seamlessly with the app's backend database.
